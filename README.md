  <h1 align="center">Dex [SOLUTION]</h3>

  <p align="center">
    🍍Hi  here you can found one of the solution for the challenge Dex!
  </p>
</div>

## Challenge
The goal of this level is for you to hack the basic DEX contract below and steal the funds by price manipulation.

> Solution: 
  [Dex Contract]() || [Hack Contract](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x9Adf15F9ED23e436Ba8Ef4C07DE1C97425339b34)
## Complementary information to solve the challenge

You will start with 10 tokens of token1 and 10 of token2. The DEX contract starts with 100 of each token.

You will be successful in this level if you manage to drain all of at least 1 of the 2 tokens from the contract, and allow the contract to report a "bad" price of the assets.

## Extra help
Normally, when you make a swap with an ERC20 token, you have to approve the contract to spend your tokens for you. To keep with the syntax of the game, we've just added the approve method to the contract itself. So feel free to use contract.approve(contract.address, <uint amount>) instead of calling the tokens directly, and it will automatically approve spending the two tokens by the desired amount. Feel free to ignore the SwappableToken contract otherwise.

  Things that might help:

* How is the price of the token calculated?
* How does the swap method work?
* How do you approve a transaction of an ERC20?
* Theres more than one way to interact with a contract!
* Remix might help
* What does "At Address" do

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
    - `node --version` and get an ouput like: `vx.x.x`
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) instead of `npm`
  - You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
    - `yarn --version` and get an output like: `x.x.x`
    - You might need to install it with npm

## Setup

## Solution explained

### Run Solution [automated solution]
 - `yarn test:unit` for local testing 
 - `yarn deploy:goerli` remember change address in `helper-hardhat-config.ts`
 - `yarn test:staging` for goerli network, just change the contract address in `helper-hardhat-config.ts`
