## About the Ethernaut 

The Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired by overthewire.org, played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine.  


## Challenge
Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.


## What will you find here?

This section will be to discover various aspects that each challenge includes so that you can complete it on your own.

You could call it as a complement to these challenges, although I will present the solution, it is not to go immediately for the solution, it is to explain what terms and concepts are involved, go deeper and understand what we are doing.

This will be the dynamic for each challenge:

- Complementary information to solve the challenge
- Extra help
- Solution explained

> Remember, this is just one way to solve it, there are many ways, feel comfortable and do it the way you think is right, make mistakes, try, but never give up.
