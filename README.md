  <h1 align="center">Magic Number [SOLUTION]</h3>

  <p align="center">
    üççHi  here you can found one of the solution for the challenge Magic Number!
  </p>
</div>

## Challenge
To solve this level, you only need to provide the Ethernaut with a Solver, a contract that responds to whatIsTheMeaningOfLife() with the right number.

> Solution: 
  [Magic Number Contract](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x2df86a480a3c15592cc60a210d764a3ec4a25ef6) || [Hack Contract](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xe8365d14d1036d81fb5da92444bebabe21989b16#internaltx)
## Complementary information to solve the challenge
The solver's code needs to be really tiny. Really reaaaaaallly tiny. Like freakin' really really itty-bitty tiny: 10 opcodes at most.

Hint: Perhaps its time to leave the comfort of the Solidity compiler momentarily, and build this one by hand O_o. That's right: Raw EVM bytecode.

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
    - `node --version` and get an ouput like: `vx.x.x`
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) instead of `npm`
  - You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
    - `yarn --version` and get an output like: `x.x.x`
    - You might need to install it with npm

## Setup

Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/pinalikefruit/ethernaut
cd ethernaut
git checkout 18-magic-number  
```

Then install dependencies

```
yarn
```
## Solution explained
Ok this challange is very different, so, we going step by step.

1. Runtime code: 
  For return always the magic number, we need use opcode
### Run Solution [automated solution]
 <!-- - `yarn test:unit` for local testing  -->
 - `yarn deploy:goerli` remember change address in `helper-hardhat-config.ts`
 - `yarn test:staging` for goerli network, just change the contract address in `helper-hardhat-config.ts`
